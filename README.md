## Big Picture Goal:
- Answer questions graphically and visually.
- Prove NosTerra’s Thesis: “abundant low-cost green energy is economically beneficial, not just socially/environmentally good.”
- Increase NosTerra’s credibility in the energy space with policymakers and investors.
- [Model Overview](START_HERE/1.%20Energy%20Model%20%20Overview.docx)

## Big Picture How:
- Build a simple-to-moderately complex modeling system that allows users to vary parameters and make predictions.
- A simplified version of this model was created by Spencer in Excel and translated to JavaScript to produce Sankey charts. We aim to enhance this process.
- [Existing Sankey](NosTerra.com/sankey-test)

### Enhancements:
- Both models rely on gathering extensive data, such as LCOE and efficiency of various energy generation methods like natural gas turbines, solar, hydroelectric, etc.
- We have identified key weaknesses in the existing data and assumptions, which we need help to address.

### Volunteer Contribution:
- We need savvy, motivated volunteers to ensure we have the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurate dataset for each sector.
- As we attempt to automate this process, we need you to document the process thoroughly.
- Our goal is to make this aggregated data available to anyone interested in designing a better future, and we aim to open-source as much as possible.

### Documentation:
- A detailed spec and examples can be found in the documentation below.
